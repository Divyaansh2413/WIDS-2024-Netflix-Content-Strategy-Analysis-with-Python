### Week 1 Assignment
## Task Overview
You are provided with a dataset. Your goal is to perform the following analyses using Python:
1. Highest Elo
Identify the player with the highest Elo rating in the dataset.

2. Top 10 Players With Highest Elo
List the top 10 players with the highest Elo ratings.

3. Time Trend of Top 20's Average Elo Each Year
Plot how the average Elo of the top 20 players has changed over the years.

4. Time Trend for Number of Players Above 2750 Elo
Visualize the trend for the number of players exceeding 2750 Elo each year.

5. Time Trend of Top 20's Average Age Each Year
Analyze the change in the average age of the top 20 players year by year.

6. Time Trend for Number of Players Under 25 Years Old in Top 20
Observe how the number of top 20 players under 25 years of age has changed over the years.

7. Time Trend of Magnus Carlsen's Elo
Track Magnus Carlsen's Elo rating over time.

## Dataset Notes
* The Date column contains values stored as strings in the format YYYY MMM (e.g., 2020 Jan). To analyze time trends:
1. Extract the year by slicing the first four characters from the date string (e.g., 2020 from 2020 Jan).
2. Convert the resulting year values into integers.

## Deliverables
* Submit a Python notebook or equivalent code with your solutions.
* Include visualizations for all time trend questions.
* Provide a brief interpretation of the trends observed in each plot.
